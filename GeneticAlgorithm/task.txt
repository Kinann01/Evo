"""
A set of  objects is given with weights  and prices . 

The goal in the knapsack problem is to find a subset of these objects that maximizes the 
cumulative price (i.e., the sum of the prices of objects in this subset), such that their 
total weight (i.e., the sum of the weights of objects in the subset) is less than or equal to a given limit .

The task is to implement an evolutionary algorithm to solve this problem. You can either 
program the entire algorithm from scratch or use something we implemented in the exercises.

You will receive four files specifying the input. Each of these files contains several lines. 
The first line contains two numbers: the number of objects $n$ and the capacity of the knapsack . 
Then there are  lines, each containing the price  and weight  of one object. The values on 
individual lines are separated by a space.
